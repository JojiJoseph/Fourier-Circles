# Fourier Circles Animation

This project is a Python-based script for animating Fourier Circles. It allows users to draw a closed curve using the mouse in a window, and then animates the approximation of this curve using Fourier Transform represented as a series of circles.

## Demo

## How to run

```python
python main.py
```
Then draw a closed curve. The animation will be opened in a new window.

By default number of Fourier Circles is the number of points in the input curve.

To set number of points to a specific value (say 100),

```python
python main.py -N 100
```
